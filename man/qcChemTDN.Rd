\title{List all routine samples where total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) values exceeded total nitrogen (UTN) values, and flag whether the discrepancy was within precision limits or outside of the expected error.}
\usage{
qcChemTDN(park, site, field.season)
}
\arguments{
\item{park}{Optional. Four-letter park code to filter on, e.g. "GRBA".}

\item{site}{Optional. Site code to filter on, e.g. "GRBA_L_BAKR0".}

\item{field.season}{Optional. Field season name to filter on, e.g. "2019".}

\item{conn}{Database connection generated from call to \code{OpenDatabaseConnection()}. Ignored if \code{data.source} is \code{"local"}.}

\item{path.to.data}{The directory containing the csv data exports generated from \code{SaveDataToCsv()}. Ignored if \code{data.source} is \code{"database"}.}

\item{data.source}{Character string indicating whether to access data in the live Streams and Lakes database (\code{"database"}, default) or to use data saved locally (\code{"local"}). In order to access the most up-to-date data, it is recommended that you select \code{"database"} unless you are working offline or your code will be shared with someone who doesn't have access to the database.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns SampleFrame, SiteCode, SiteName, FieldSeason, VisitDate, Unit, UTN, TDN, TDNvUTN, TDNFlag.
